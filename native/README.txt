===================================================

What is this?
-------------

This is the filter code you need to build to send across
the network to your OpenDiamond server, for running searches
using these filters.


How to build?
-------------

Run "make". Because of the way OpenDiamond works, you may need
a cross-compiler to build these binaries so that they will run on
your server. You may also need specially-compiled static libraries.


What is the license?
--------------------
